        <h2>About</h2>
        CCBB Was created as a second year university group project, as part of our 3D Game Development module. Winning best group at the 2023 End of year show. <br>
              Conveyer Craze Burger Builder is a silly game about stacking sandwiches on a moving conveyer belt to customers orders,
              Heavily inspired by the Papa's series of games, you must keep customers happy, obeying their orders correctly on a day to day basis.<br>
              As the days pass you unlock new ingredients and customers orders grow in complexity and numbers creating a tense progressive experience, score high by collecting cash along the way. and any bonus items that appear throughout playtime.
        <h2>My role</h2>
        Although the game was simplistic in nature it had many features that needed to be implemented and implemented well to compliment the overall gameplay experience, a focus on polish, playability and accessibility were key throughout development.<br>

        My roles mainly covered the Drag&Drop system of ingredients, stacking functionality for sandwiches as well as the all of the physics used for the game logic, detection of ingredients and score accumulation, in addition I was also responsible for the ticket/order generation and Ticket UI.
