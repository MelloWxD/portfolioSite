                        Entombed was created in my third year of University for my Advanced Console Games Projects Module, it was created on Playstation 5 Developer kits from scratch using some of Sony's libraries and pure C++ over 6 months.
                        Based on a brief of Folklore Entobmed puts you in the shoes of a skeptic treasure hunter who thinks they know better than the superstitious types who dare not venture into the Draugr's tomb.
